# ROS---ROSBOT

The purpose of this project is to develop C++ code to drive ROSBOT autonomously. ROSbot is an autonomous, open-source robot platform that runs the CORE2-ROS controller. As its name indicates, ROSbot is based on the Robot Operating System(ROS) and can be programmed either with c++ or with python. ROSbot comes with multiple sensors, Lidar, camera and many other electronic components. The purpose of this project is to program the ROSbot in order to move from an initial point to the finish line autonomously by avoiding to collide with obstacles. This project took place in a lab room. In order to simulate a natural environment for the ROSbot, multiple obstacles were placed around the place in order to detect the credibility and reliability of our code in many different obstacle scenarios. As such multiple small and big obstacles were placed in positions the robot would typically pass through.
